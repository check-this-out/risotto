# Risotto
Package risotto is a JavaScript to JavaScript compiler. Risotto's parser and AST is forked from [otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto).
The main motivation behind Risotto is to be used by [Gonads](https://github.com/mamaar/gonads), a frontend toolkit that currently compiles JSX and SASS.
